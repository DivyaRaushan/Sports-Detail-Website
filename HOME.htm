<H2>BCCI Announces Squad For India's Tour Of Australia, Rohit Sharma Not Named</H2>
<HR>

<b>The BCCI's senior national selection committee announced the Indian squad for the Australia tour, comprising fours Tests, three ODIs and as many T20Is 	 The BCCI's Senior National Selection Committee on Monday announced the Indian squads for the Australia tour, comprising fours Tests, three One-day Internationals and as many Twenty20 Internationals. 

India's limited-overs vice-captain Rohit Sharma, who is currently battling with a hamstring injury, has not been picked in any of the three squads, with BCCI saying that their medical team will continue to monitor his progress. 

Another notable name missing from the Test squad is veteran fast bowler Ishant Sharma, who was ruled out of the IPL with a rib injury. The BCCI's medical team will also keep track of his progress.

KL Rahul, who is having a dream run in the ongoing IPL 2020, has replaced Rohit in the longest format. The Kings XI Punjab skipper has also been handed the leadership responsibility for the first time in his international career, as he has appointed as Kohli's deputy in both ODI and T20I squads. 

Royal Challengers Bangalore fast-bowling duo of Navdeep Saini and Mohammed Siraj have been rewarded for their impressive performances with a place in the red-ball squad.

Kolkata Knight Riders' mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy, who became the first bowler to pick up a five-wicket haul in the IPL 2020, has earned a maiden call-up to the Indian team, with a place in the shortest format squad. Interestingly, Rishabh Pant is not part of the limiter-overs squad, with Sanju Samson included as a backup keeper in the shortest format, while KL Rahul included as the lone wicket-keeper in ODI side.

Shikhar Dhawan, who missed India's tour of New Zealand earlier this year with an injury, has made a comeback into the side on the back of his superb form in the IPL, which saw him becoming the first player ever to score back-to-back centuries in the cash-rich league.

Chennai Super Kings fast bowler Deepak Chahar has also made a comeback to the T20I side.

The BCCI also announced that four additional fast bowlers -- Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Kartik Tyagi, Ishan Porel and T. Natarajan -- will be travelling with the Indian contingent.

<H2>Russell says Williams exit rumours ‘fed by Perez camp’ as Mercedes vow to back him</H2>
<HR>

<b>George Russell says he has a contract with Williams for 2021 and that rumours suggesting he was to be pushed out were being “fed by the [Sergio] Perez camp” after the Mexican was linked with the team.Perez was let go by Racing Point, with four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel coming onboard next year alongside Lance Stroll, and the eight-time podium finisher has been exploring his options for 2021, one of which is understood to have involved talks with Williams’ new owners Dorilton.

The belief is that Russell, rather than Nicholas Latifi, who brings significant financial backing, would be the driver to make way should Williams decide to change things up – but Russell was bullish about his future, having spoken to the new owners during the Portuguese Grand Prix weekend.
“Nothing’s changed from my side,” said Russell, who is a Mercedes junior driver. “I try and do my talking on the track, and as I said before I am not concerned for next year. I know Mercedes and Toto [Wolff] have my back. They’ve told me that. Toto himself has told me that, which I absolutely trust.

“I think all this speculation has probably been fed by the Perez camp who are trying to apply pressure on other teams further down the grid. Potentially [for] a Red Bull seat. So that’s my views on it, I’ve got a contract, I’ve got nothing to worry about and I’m just here trying to do that.

“I spoke with them [the new owners], they said don’t worry, and everything’s going to be fine. We had a small chat about it and moved on to talking about the rest of this year, moving into next year and how we’re going to push the team further forward, which is enough for me.”

Russell added that he reckons “everything will be fine” and that the situation would be “100% clarified from the team’s perspective, probably no later than the end of the week”.

Meanwhile Mercedes boss Wolff said it is up to Williams to decide what they do, and he would keep Russell on board if it was up to him, but if the team decide to go another way, Mercedes will continue to support their young driver.

“I think it’s not looking bad to be honest,” said Wolff of Russell’s future at Williams. “There are a lot of theories whether he stays or not and there are drivers, clearly good guys, also with a bit of budget there. I think the reason why the investors have come in is that they want to be competitive.

“They have made a sensible plan on how to increase performance every year and they are not expecting any wonders short-term but they have a clear path to success over the next few years and I think that George can play a role in there. He’s clearly performing very well, the team likes him. If I were them I would keep him.
“Whether he stays or not, if he stays then we have to make a decision next year what to do and if he doesn’t stay then it becomes more of an imminent topic. Let’s see what happens.

He added: “If George were to slip through the system I would be happy to take him in our squad, we will have a sensational reserve. I would put him through a mega testing programme and prepare him in the best way for a 2022 blast.”

<H2>Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the best - not the best: Ibrahimovic.</H2>

<b>

Zlatan Ibrahimovic has branded Cristiano Ronaldo one of the best players in the world, but stopped short of suggesting he is the game`s finest footballer.

Paris Saint-Germain have repeatedly been linked with a move for the Real Madrid forward, whose contract at the Santiago Bernabeu runs out in just under two years` time.

And ahead of a friendly between the European giants on Saturday, the 31-year-old claimed it makes sense for a top club like les Parisiens to be associated with the former Manchester United man, who he categorises as among the greatest in the game.

"Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the best players in the world," he told reporters on Friday at a PSG press conference.

"The fact that he is often linked to PSG, this is normal, because the project of the club is to become the best in Europe and therefore attract the best players."


When the translator for the press mistakenly said Ibrahimovic had called Ronaldo "the best in the world", the former AC Milan and Barcelona forward added in English: "No, he`s one of the best - not the best."

The clash between the Blancos and PSG kicks off at 20:00CET on Saturday.</b><HR>

<H2>Novak Djokovic thrashed in worst loss of his career</H2>

Novak Djokovic suffered his heaviest ever defeat in a three-set match on Friday when he was knocked out of the Vienna ATP tournament by lucky loser Lorenzo Sonego, stalling his bid to wrap up the year-end world number one ranking for a sixth time.
Italian Sonego, ranked 42 and who had initially lost in qualifying last weekend, is the first lucky loser ever to beat Djokovic.

His 6-2, 6-1 quarter-final stunner was 33-year-old Djokovic’s heaviest ever defeat.

The only other time the Serb had won just three games was at the 2005 Australian Open at the hands of Marat Safin in a best-of-five set encounter.
“He just blew me off the court, that’s all,” Djokovic told atptour.com. “He was better in every segment of the game. It was a pretty bad match from my side, but amazing from his side.

“He definitely deserved this result,” added the Serb star who was playing his first tournament since his Roland Garros final defeat to Rafael Nadal three weeks ago.

Friday’s defeat means Djokovic will have to wait a little longer before he completes the formality of equalling Pete Sampras’s all-time record of ending the season top of the rankings for a sixth time.

“For sure it’s the best victory of my life. Novak is the best in the world. Today I played so, so good,” Sonego said.

“It’s unbelievable. It’s amazing. I played the best match in my life. I’m so happy for this.”

Sonego fired 26 winners past the Serb who lost for only the third time in 2020. Djokovic, a 17-time major champion, managed just seven winners against 25 unforced errors.

Sonego goes on to face either Britain’s Dan Evans or Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria for a place in the final.
